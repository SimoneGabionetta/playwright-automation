### Automating tests in 5 steps

1.  Open/start browser and access system URL
2.  Locate elements (button, title, etc.) - look at the structure of the HTML page - find the unique identifier - selectors class, id, xpath
3.  Interact with elements (actions - click, fill, select, automated test - simulate user behavior)
4.  Check expected result (check if the result matches what was expected - to validate use assertions - ensure expectations were met)
5. Preparatory actions - before, during or after the test that help to do something (it will not always be necessary - in cases you need - mass random data before or during the test, insert DB data - e.g. email that cannot be repeated for each test, generate random email, etc.)
